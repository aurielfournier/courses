#these are similar

hist(data1$age) #nicely normally distributed
hist(data1$cholesterol) #slightly skewed to the left
data1$chol2 = data1$cholesterol^(1/2)
hist(data1$chol2) #this is a better distribtuion
data1 = data1[,c("chol2","state","age")]

#this is just a one way anova to look at the difference between longevity and mating partner treatment
lm1 = lm(data=data1, chol2~state)
summary(lm1) #there is not a difference between state and cholesterol level
#look at residuals
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm1)
#the residuals dont' look bad, there is slight deivation from the normal QQ plot


lm2 = lm(data=data1, age~state)
summary(lm2) # this is not significant, so state of origin do not explain age, shocking stuff


#linearity assumptions
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=data1, aes(x=chol2, y=age, group=state, colour=state))

#ancova looking at the impact of mating partner treatment and thorax lenght on longetivy 
lm3 = lm(data=data1, chol2 ~ age+state)
summary(lm3) # there is a significant difference by age, but not by state


#check for paralell slopes
lm4 = lm(data=data1, chol2~ age*state )
summary(lm4) #age is significant, but there is not a signficant interaction

#so we can go back to lm1, which was a regular ANOVA, but there was also not a difference there
#this suggests that there is no relationship between state and cholesterol level, but there is one with age, which is increasing in both cases.
